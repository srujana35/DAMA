Adapting **AlphaEdit** for **debiasing** requires modifying the way it computes and applies updates. Hereâ€™s how you can systematically transform AlphaEdit to focus on **removing biased knowledge** instead of modifying factual knowledge.

## **Steps to Modify AlphaEdit for Debiasing**
1. **Identify Bias in Model Representations**
2. **Define Debiased Representations**
3. **Compute Bias Residuals**
4. **Update Weights Using AlphaEdit**
5. **Ensure Stability and Generalization**

## **Step-by-Step Code Modifications**

### **1. Identify Bias in Model Representations**
- Instead of editing facts (like modifying a personâ€™s birthplace in a model), we need to **locate where biases are encoded** in the modelâ€™s activations.
- Bias can be **measured** using datasets like **StereoSet, WinoBias, CrowS-Pairs, and BBQ**, where biased responses are detected by analyzing model predictions.
- Use **compute_ks** (used in AlphaEdit for key-value extraction) to analyze representations of biased vs. unbiased sentences.

ðŸ”¹ **Modify `compute_ks` to extract biased activations**:
```python
def compute_bias_vectors(model, tok, bias_examples, hparams, layer, context_templates):
    """
    Extracts key vectors corresponding to biased sentences.
    """
    bias_ks = compute_ks(model, tok, bias_examples, hparams, layer, context_templates)
    return bias_ks.T  # Transpose to match input-output shapes
```
- `bias_examples` should be **pairs of biased and neutral statements**, so that later we can compute the difference.

---

### **2. Define Debiased Representations**
- Instead of targeting "correct factual knowledge" (as AlphaEdit does), we want to **neutralize bias**.
- The **target debiased representation** should be an **average neutral embedding** or a **projection that removes bias**.

ðŸ”¹ **Compute bias-neutralized activations:**
```python
def compute_debiased_activations(model, tok, neutral_examples, hparams, layer, context_templates):
    """
    Extracts key vectors corresponding to neutral/unbiased sentences.
    """
    neutral_ks = compute_ks(model, tok, neutral_examples, hparams, layer, context_templates)
    return neutral_ks.T  # Transpose to match input-output shapes
```
- `neutral_examples` are unbiased versions of the biased statements.

---

### **3. Compute Bias Residuals**
- In AlphaEdit, the `z` vector represents **desired knowledge to inject**.
- Here, we compute **bias residuals**, the difference between biased and unbiased activations.

ðŸ”¹ **Modify `compute_z` to focus on debiasing:**
```python
def compute_bias_residuals(model, tok, bias_examples, neutral_examples, hparams, layer, context_templates):
    """
    Computes residuals between biased and unbiased representations.
    """
    bias_ks = compute_bias_vectors(model, tok, bias_examples, hparams, layer, context_templates)
    neutral_ks = compute_debiased_activations(model, tok, neutral_examples, hparams, layer, context_templates)

    residuals = bias_ks - neutral_ks  # Compute the shift needed to neutralize bias
    return residuals
```
- This `residuals` tensor replaces `zs` (AlphaEditâ€™s knowledge vector) and represents **how much bias should be removed per layer**.

---

### **4. Apply Weight Updates Using AlphaEdit**
- Instead of injecting new factual knowledge, we use **P (projection matrix)** to **remove biased information** from activations.

ðŸ”¹ **Modify the weight update step in `apply_AlphaEdit_to_model`:**
```python
for i, layer in enumerate(hparams.layers):
    print(f"\n\nLAYER {layer}\n")

    # Extract key activations for biased examples
    layer_ks = compute_bias_vectors(model, tok, bias_examples, hparams, layer, context_templates).T
    print(f"Neutralizing {layer_ks.size(1)} bias representations in layer {layer}")

    # Compute bias residuals (difference between biased & unbiased activations)
    targets = compute_bias_residuals(model, tok, bias_examples, neutral_examples, hparams, layer, context_templates)

    print("Bias residual norm", torch.linalg.norm(targets, dim=0).mean())

    repeat_factor = layer_ks.size(1) // targets.size(1)
    targets = targets.repeat_interleave(repeat_factor, dim=1)
    resid = targets / (len(hparams.layers) - i)  # Distribute residual across layers

    # Solve for update matrix
    upd_matrix = torch.linalg.solve(
        P[i,:,:].cuda() @ (layer_ks @ layer_ks.T + cache_c[i,:,:].cuda()) + hparams.L2*torch.eye(layer_ks.shape[0], dtype=torch.float,device="cuda"), 
        P[i,:,:].cuda() @ layer_ks @ resid.T
    )

    # Apply debiasing update
    weight_name = f"{hparams.rewrite_module_tmp.format(layer)}.weight"
    upd_matrix = upd_matrix_match_shape(upd_matrix, weights[weight_name].shape)
    print("orig norm", torch.linalg.norm(weights[weight_name]))
    print("upd norm", torch.linalg.norm(upd_matrix))
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        weights[weight_name][...] = weights[weight_name] - upd_matrix  # **Subtract to remove bias**
```
- The **key change** here is **subtracting** the bias update instead of adding it, ensuring we are **removing bias instead of reinforcing knowledge**.

---

### **5. Ensure Stability and Generalization**
- To prevent **over-debiasing**, introduce **regularization** to ensure the model does not lose **useful** information.
- Add a **regularization term** based on the covariance matrix:
```python
lambda_reg = 0.1  # Adjust regularization weight
upd_matrix = torch.linalg.solve(
    P[i,:,:].cuda() @ (layer_ks @ layer_ks.T + cache_c[i,:,:].cuda()) + lambda_reg * torch.eye(layer_ks.shape[0], dtype=torch.float,device="cuda"),
    P[i,:,:].cuda() @ layer_ks @ resid.T
)
```
- You can dynamically **adjust `lambda_reg`** based on how much bias is being removed.

---

## **Final Workflow for AlphaEdit Debiasing**
1. **Identify Biases in Model Representations**
   - Extract key-value pairs from biased examples.
2. **Define Debiased Representations**
   - Extract neutral/unbiased representations.
3. **Compute Bias Residuals**
   - Compute the difference between biased and unbiased embeddings.
4. **Apply Weight Updates**
   - Subtract the bias update matrix at specific layers.
5. **Ensure Stability**
   - Add a regularization term to prevent excessive changes.

## **Key Takeaways**
âœ… **Fine-grained control**: Unlike DAMA, which uses **projection-based rank reduction**, this method **directly modifies activations** to remove bias at targeted layers.  
âœ… **More adaptable**: You can customize which forms of bias to remove based on different datasets (e.g., gender bias vs. racial bias).  
âœ… **Memory-efficient**: Using **cached covariance matrices** allows efficient computation of bias correction updates.  
âœ… **Avoids catastrophic forgetting**: Regularization ensures that useful model capabilities are **preserved while reducing bias**.  

This approach **modifies AlphaEdit from a knowledge-injection tool to a bias-mitigation method**, making it a strong alternative to DAMA for fine-tuned debiasing. ðŸš€
